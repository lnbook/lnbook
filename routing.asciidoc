== Routing on a Network of Payment channels
In this section you will finally understand how payment channels can be connected to a network of payment channels via what we call routing.
When we say routing, we refer to the series of interactions across the network that allow a payment to _flow_ from point A to point B.
This differs from _path finding_ which was covered earlier as this refers to the _active_ process of sending payments, while path finding can be seen as a re-processing step.
An important rule of thumb to remember is that it's possible for a path to exist between Alice and Bob, yet there may be a lack of an active _route_ at any given point.
On concrete eaxmple of such a scenario can be illustrated by assuming that all the nodes connecting Alice and Bob are currently off-line. 
In this case, one can examine the _payment graph_ to construct a path for a payment, but the payment cannot be sent as an _active route_ does not exist.

The innovation of routed payment channels, allows our gamer Gloria to receive funds from her viewers without being required to maintain a separate channel with every of her viewers who want to tip her.
As long as there exists a path of well funded payment channels from a fan to Gloria she will be able to receive money.
Despite the fact that the nodes along the path forward the money to Gloria they are not able to steal the money and run with it.
Similarly, they cannot lose money while participating in the routing process.
They are however entitled to charge a routing fee for their service.
In particular due to the used Onion routing intermediary nodes will not know who is the initiator of the payment and who is the final recipient.
Being able to connect payment channels yields the main value proposition behind the lightning network.
While a single channel between two users already takes load from the Bitcoin network if those users were to financially interact often a network as described allows off chain payments between arbitrary participants without the need of opening and maintaining a direct payment channel between them.
In this chapter you will first learn in a non technical way how the Bitcoin Network changes its role of being a transaction settlement layer to being a contract settlement layer.
Afterwards the technical Hashed Time Locked Contracts are introduced and explained.
You will learn how they are included into the commitment transactions and how neighboring nodes communicate with each other to set the HTLCs up and settle them.
Finally, you will learn about the SPHINX mix Format that enables onion routing which grants payments with a high degree of privacy.


=== Creating a Network of payment channels
While technically a few challenges have to be addressed the core idea behind a network of payment channels is quite easy.
Let us Assume after Alice bought her coffee at Bobs coffee shop with which she had opened a channel she enjoys the live stream of our gamer Gloria who accepts donations via the Lightning Network from her viewers.
Alice and Gloria are not owning a mutual payment channel and do not wish to do so.
However they are connected via the network of payment channels in the following way.
Bob has an open channel with his the software developer Wei who helps him with technical issues of the point of sale system he uses in his coffee shop.
Wei is actually the owner of a large software company which also develops the game that Gloria plays so that she had opened a channel with the company to pay for the games license, access to the server and in game items.
Now it is easy to understand that Alice could use this path of channels to send a tip of a few thousand satoshis to Bob and ask him to forward the money via Wei to Gloria.

[[routing-network]]
.The network of payment channels of our friends can be seen here:
image:images/routing-network.png[]

The main challenge is to do this in a way that prevents Bob and Wei from stealing the money that Alice wants to be delivered to Gloria.
To understand how the Lightning Network protects the payment packages that are being routed through the network we compare the situation of indirect payments with physical payments with gold coins in the offline world.
Let us assume Alice wanted to give 10 gold coins to Gloria and decides to ask Bob and Wei for help.
How could Alice make sure that Bob and Alice do not run with the gold coins after receiving them?
In the physical world contracts could be used for safely doing such a cascade of payments.
Alice could negotiate a contract with Bob which reads:

_I (Alice) will give you (Bob) 10 golden coins if you pass them on to Wei_

While this contract is nice in the real world Alice yields the issue that Bob might just breach the contract and hope not to get caught by law enforcement.
Even if Bob got caught by law enforcement Alice faces the risk that he might be bankrupt and her 10 golden coins would be gone anyway.
Assuming these issues are magically solved it would still be unclear to from a contract point of view that Wei also has to have a contract with Gloria to deliver the coins.
Thus we improve our contract:

_I (Alice) will reimburse you (Bob) with 10 golden coins if you can proof to me (for example via a receipt) that you already have delivered 10 golden coins to Wei_

Now you might ask yourself why should Bob sign such a contract as Bob now has the risk of getting reimbursed?
In economics a risk can usually be priced so Alice could offer a routing fee of 1 Golden coin to Bob and another one to Wei. Thus the contract will be altered onces more:

_I (Alice) will reimburse you (Bob) with 12 golden coins if you can proof to me (for example via a receipt) that you already have delivered 11 golden coins to Wei_

Alice now promises Bob 12 golden coins.
10 to be delivered to Gloria and two for the fees.
She promises 12 to Bob if he shows proof that he has forwarded 11.
The difference of 1 golden coin is the fee that Bob will earn for helping out with this particular payment process.

As there is still the issue of trust and that even law inforcement does not protect Alice and Bob from malicious behavior they decide to add an escrow service.
Of course Alice and Bob both have to trust this escrow service.
Having such an escrow Alice could already provide the 12 golden coins to that service which would only release them to Bob if Bob shows the proof of delivering 11 golden coins to Wei.

In fact this proof could include a secret that only Gloria knows but the contract could be commited to this secret for example by including the sha256 hash of the secret to the contract.
We call this hash the payment hash.

In reality Gloria would come up with a large random number as a secret.
This is to be really secure and prevent others from guessing it.
But let us assume that in our case Glorias secret take reads `*Glorias secret*`.
She would commit to the secret by computing the sha256 hash which reads `*f23c83babfb0e5f001c5030cf2a06626f8a940af939c1c35bd4526e90f9759f5*`.
You can verify this by typing `echo -n "Glorias secret" | sha256sum` to your linux command line.

As Alice wants to send 10 golden coins to Gloria she is told by Gloria to use this payment hash to receive a proof of payment.
Alice now sets up a contract that reads:

_I (Alice) will reimburse you (Bob) with 12 golden coins if you can show me a valid message - we call it preimage - that hashes to `*f23c83babfb0e5f001c5030cf2a06626f8a940af939c1c35bd4526e90f9759f5*`. You can acquire this message by setting up a similar Contract with Wei who has to set up a similar contract with Gloria. In order to assure you that you will get reimbursed I will provide the 12 Golden coins to an trusted escrow before you set up your next contract._

After Bob and Alice agree to the contract and Bob receives the message from the escrow that Alice has deposited the 12 golden coins Bob negotiates a very similar contract with Wei.
Note that due to the service fees he will only forward 11 golden coins to Wei and demand from Wei who also wants to earn a fee of 1 golden coin to show proof that 10 golden coins have been delivered to Gloria.

_I (Bob) will reimburse you (Wei) with 11 golden coins if you can show me a valid message - we call it preimage - that hashes to `*f23c83babfb0e5f001c5030cf2a06626f8a940af939c1c35bd4526e90f9759f5*`. You can acquire this message by setting up a similar contract with Gloria. In order to assure you that you will get reimbursed I will provide the 11 Golden coins to an trusted escrow before you set up your next contract._


As Wei gets message from the escrow that Bob has deposited the 10 golden coins Wei sets up a similar contract with Gloria:

_I (Wei) will reimburse you (Gloria) with 10 golden coins if you can show me a valid message - we call it preimage - that hashes to `*f23c83babfb0e5f001c5030cf2a06626f8a940af939c1c35bd4526e90f9759f5*`. In order to assure you that you will get reimbursed after revealing the secret I will provide the 10 Golden coins to an trusted escrow._

As Gloria learns from the escrow that the coins where deposited she reveals the secret preimage to Wei.
Since she initially came up with the secret and committed to it in form of the payment hash she obviously is able to provide the secrete to Wei and their escrow service.
Wei takes the preimage as a proof of payment and shows it to Bob.
The escrow service releases the money so that Wei is reimbursed.
Now Bob repeats the process by fulfilling the contract between Alice and him with the help of the secret preimage.

With such a chain of contracts Bob and Wei have not been able to run with the money as they actually deposited money first.
However if Gloria or anyone along this chain does not release the secrete preimage everyone has already send golden coins to their escrow service but will never get reimbursed.
So while no one could steal money from Alice everyone could still lose money.
This is obviously not desirable.
Luckily this can be resolved by including a deadline to the contract.
Reaching the deadline the contract has to be fulfilled or otherwise it would be invalidated and the escrow service would return the money to the person who made the original deposit.
We call this deadline a time lock as the deposit is locked with the escrow service for a certain amount of time and then released even if no proof of payment was provided.

The Contract between Alice and Bob is appended by the following statement:

_Bob has 24 hours to show the secret after the contract was signed. If the time has passed Alice will get her deposit back from the escrow service and the contract becomes invalid._

Bob of course now has to make sure to get receive the proof of payment faster than in 24 hours.
If he would receive a later proof the contract between him and Alice would already be nullified and Bob would not get reimbursed.
After he signed the contract with Alice he alters the original contract between him and Wei in the following way:

_Wei has 22 hours to show the secret after the contract was signed. If the time has passed Bob will get his deposit back from the escrow service and the contract becomes invalid._

As you have guessed Wei is now incentiviced to also alter his contract with Gloria:

_Gloria has 20 hours to show the secret after the contract was signed. If the time has passed Wei will get his deposit back from the escrow service and the contract becomes invalid._

With such a chain of contracts we can be sure that after 24 hours of setting up the first contract that the payment was either successfully delivered from Alice via Bob and Wei to Gloria or that the payment has failed and was not conducted at all.
It cannot be stuck in the middle of the road.
Also - as long as the escrow service is trustworthy - neither party could have stolen or lost the golden coins in the process.
There is only the necessity that everyone along this path already had to have some money to be able to provide deposits.
While this seems like a minor necessity we will see in a later chapter about pathfinding that this requirement is actually one of the harder issues for Lightning Network nodes.
Also the parties cannot utilize this money while being locked otherwise.
However as discussed their opportunity cost is reimbursed by taking a routing fee for forwarding the payment.

In the following two sections you will learn that the bitcoin scripting language is able to set up such contracts which we call hashed time locked contracts.
You will see that the bitcoin network acts as the trusted third party or escrow for those HTLCs.
This is true as the HTLCs are created as outputs in this commitment transactions of the payment channels which would be enforced by the bitcoin network in case some party becomes unresponsive or tries to act in a fraudulent way.
Finally in the last section you will learn how the path of intermediaries is encrypted and hidden from the intermediaries so that they will only know their next hop with whom they should set up an HTLC and deliver the encrypted message that has more forwarding instructions.
This process is called onion routing.

=== Forwarding payments with HTLCs
In previous chapters we have seen that payment channels are maintained by two nodes by keeping two disjoint sequences of commitment transactions.
The pair of latest commitment transactions in both sequences encodes the current, agreed upon balance in the channel.
We have stated that two channel partners negotiate a new commitment transaction in order to change the balance and conduct a payment from one to another.
We are finally at the point to explain the communications protocol via Lightning messages and the usage of HTLCs that is executed within a payment channel to change the balance.
The same protocol will be executed along a path of channels if the network of channels is being utilized to make a payment between two participants without requiring them to have a dedicated payment channel connecting them directly.

Let us start with the payment channel with a capacity of 100 mBTC between Alice and Bob.
at its current state Alice and Bob have agreed that 20 mBTC belong to Bob and 80 mBTC belong to Alice.
As Alice bought a coffee flatrate for the week she has to pay 15 mBTC to Bob and wants to use this channel.
Just creating a new pair of commitment transactions and signing them is not so easy as the old ones have to be invalidated by sharing the revocation secret.
This process should be executed in a way that it is atomic meaning the nodes will either be able to negotiate a new state without giving the other side the chance to play tricks or it should fail.

[[routing-setup-htlc-0]]
.Let us look at the initial pair of most recent commitment transactions for Alice and Bob:
image:images/routing-setup-htlc-0.png[]

Alice sends the `update_add_HTLC` Lightning message to Bob.
The message type is 128 and has the following data fields:

* [`channel_id`:`channel_id`]
* [`u64`:`id`]
* [`u64`:`amount_msat`]
* [`sha256`:`payment_hash`]
* [`u32`:`cltv_expiry`]
* [`1366*byte`:`onion_routing_packet`]

As Bob and Alice might have more than one channel thus the `channel_id` is included to the message.
The `id` counter counts starts with 0 for the first HTLC that Alice offers to Bob and is increased by 1 with every subsequent offer.
The id of the HTLC is used to compute the derivation path of the bitcoin key that is used for the output of this particular HTLC.
In this way addresses changes with every payment and cannot be monitored by a third party.
Next the amount that Alice wants to send to Bob is entered to the `amount_msat` field.
As the name suggests the amount is depicted in millisatoshi even those cannot be enforced within the commitment transaction and within bitcoin.
Still Lightning nodes keep track of subsatoshi amounts to avoid rounding issues.
As in the offline example Alice includes the `payment_hash` in the next data field.
This was told to Alice by Bob in case she wants to just send money to him.
If Alice was to send Money to Gloria the Payment hash would have been given to Alice by Gloria.
We discussed the potential of time lock or deadline of the contract.
This is encoded in the `cltv_expiry`.
cltv stands for OP_CHECKTIMELOCKVERIFY and is the OP_CODE that will be used in the HTLC output and serve as the deadline in which the contract is valid.
Finally in the last data field there are 1336 Bytes of data included which is an `onion routing packet`.
The format of this packet will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.
For now it is important to note that it includes encrypted routing hints and information of the payment path that can only be partially decrypted by the recipient of the onion routing packet to extract information to whom to forward the payment or to learn that one as the final recipient.
In any case the onion roting packet is always of the same size preventing the possibility to guess the position of an intermediary node within a path.
In our particular case Bob will be able to decrypt the first couple bytes of the onion routing packet and learn that the payment is not to be forwarded but intended to be for him.

The received information is enough for Bob to create a new commitment transaction.
This commitment transaction now has not only 2 outputs encoding the balance between Alice and Bob but a third output which encodes the hashed time locked contract.

[[routing-setup-htlc-1]]
.Lets look at the newly created commitment transaction for Bob:
image:images/routing-setup-htlc-1.png[]

We can see that Bob Assumes that Alice will agree to lock 15 mBTC of her previous balance and assign it to the HTLC output.
Creating this HTLC output can be compared to giving Alice golden coins to the escrow service.
In our situation the bitcoin network can enforce the HTLC as Bob and Alice have agreed upon.
Bob's Balance has not changed yet.
In Bitcoin outputs are mainly described by scripts.
The received HTLC in Bob's commitment transaction will use the following bitcoin script to define the output:


   # To remote node with revocation key
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        <remote_HTLCpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        OP_IF
            # To local node via HTLC-success transaction.
            OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
            2 OP_SWAP <local_HTLCpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node after timeout.
            OP_DROP <cltv_expiry> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
    OP_ENDIF

We can see that there are basically three conditions to claim the output.

1. Directly if a revocation key is known. This would happen if at a later state Bob fraudulently publishes this particular commitment transaction. As a newer state could only be agreed upon if Alice has learnt Bob's half of the revocation secret she could directly claim the funds and keep them even if Bob was later able to provide a proof of payment. This is mainly described in this line `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL` and can be down by using `<revocation_sig> <revocationpubkey> as a witness script.
2. If Bob has successfully delivered the payment and learnt the preimage he can spend the HTLC output with the help of the preimage and his `local_HTLC_secret`. This is to make sure that only Bob can spend this output if the commitment transaction hits the chain and not any other third party who might know the preimage because they had been included in the routing process. Claiming this output requires an HTLC-success transaction which we describe later.
3. Finally Alice can use her `remote_HTLC_secret` to spend the HTLC output after the timeout of `cltv_expiry` was passed by using the following witness script `<remoteHTLCsig> 0`

As the commitment transaction spends the 2 out of 2 multisig funding transaction Bob needs two signatures after he constructed this commitment transaction.
He can obviously compute his own signature but he needs also the signature from Alice.
As Alice initiated the payment and wanted the HTLC to be set up she will be reluctant to provide a signature.


[[routing-setup-htlc-2]]
.Alice sends the `commitment_signed` Lightning Message to Bob:
image:images/routing-setup-htlc-2.png[]

We can see in the diagram that Bob now has two valid commitment transactions.
Let us have a quick look at the `commitment_signed` Lightning message which has the type 132.
It has 4 data fields:

* [`channel_id`:`channel_id`]
* [`signature`:`signature`]
* [`u16`:`num_HTLCs`]
* [`num_HTLCs*signature`:`HTLC_signature`]

First it again states which for which of the channels between Alice and Bob this message is intended.
Then it has included a signature for the entire commitment transaction.
As commitment transactions can have several HTLCs and HTLC success transactions need signatures which might not be provided at the time when they are needed those signatures are all already send over to Bob.
If all signatures are valid Bob has a new commitment transaction.
At this time he would be able to publish either the old one or the new one without getting a penality as the old one is not yet revoked and invalidated.
However this is save for Alice as Bob has less money in this old state and is economically not incentivised to publish the old commitment transaction.
Alice on the other side has no problem if Bob publishes the new commitment transaction as she wanted to send him money.
If Bob can provide the preimage he is by their agreement and expectation entitled to claim the HTLC output.
Should Bob decide to sabotage to future steps of the protocol Alice can either publish her commitment transaction without Bob being able to punish her.
He will just not have received the funds from Alice.
This is important!
Despite the fact that Bob has a new commitment transaction with two valid signatures and an HTLC output inside he cannot seen his HTLC as being set up successfully.
He first needs to have Alice invalidate her old state.
That is why - in the case that he is not the final recipient of the funds - he should not forward the HTLC yet by setting up a new HTLC on the next channel with Wei.
Alice will not invalidate her commitment transaction yet as she has to first get her new commitment transaction and she wants Bob to invalidate his old commitment transaction which he can safely do at this time.

[[routing-setup-htlc-3]]
.Bob sends a `revoke_and_ack` Lighting message to Alice:
image:images/routing-setup-htlc-3.png[]

The `revoke_and_ack` Lightning message contains three data fields.
* [`channel_id`:`channel_id`]
* [`32*byte`:`per_commitment_secret`]
* [`point`:`next_per_commitment_point`]

While it is really simple and straight forward it is very crucial.
Bob shares the the `per_commitment_secret` of the old commitment transaction which serves as the revocation key and would allow Alice in future to penalize Bob if he publishes the old commitment transaction without the HTLC output.
As in a future Alice and Bob might want to negotiate additional commitment transactions he already shares back the `next_per_commitment_point` that he will use in his next commitment transaction.

Alice checks that the `per_commitment_secret` produces the last `per_commitment_point` and constructs her new commitment transaction with the HTLC output.
Alice's version of the HTLC output is slightly different to the one that Bob had.
The reason is the asymmetries of the penalty based payment channel construction protocol.
Alice is offering in her commitment transaction an HTLC to the `remote` partner of the channel while Bob as accepting and offered HTLC to himself the `local` partner of the channel.
Thus the Bitcoin script is adopted slightly.
It is a very good exercise to go through both scripts and see where they differ.
You could also try to use Bob's HTLC output script to come up with Alice's and vice versa and check your result with the following script.

    # To remote node with revocation key
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        <remote_HTLCpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        OP_NOTIF
            # To local node via HTLC-timeout transaction (timelocked).
            OP_DROP 2 OP_SWAP <local_HTLCpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node with preimage.
            OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
    OP_ENDIF

Bob can redeem the HTLC with `<remoteHTLCsig> <payment_preimage>` as the witness script and in case the commitment transaction is revoked but published by Alice, Bob can trigger the penality by spending this output immediately with the following witness script `<revocation_sig> <revocationpubkey>`.

[[routing-setup-htlc-4]]
.Bob knows how Alice's commitment transaction will look like and sends over the necessary signatures.
image:images/routing-setup-htlc-4.png[]

This process is completely symmetrical to the one where Alice sent her signatures for Bob's new commitment transaction.
Now Alice is the one having two valid commitment transactions.
Technically she can still abort the payment by publishing her old commitment transaction to the bitcoin network.
No one would lose anything as Bob knows that the contract is still being set up and not fully set up yet.
This is a little bit different than how the situation would look like in a real world scenario.
Recall Alice and Bob both have set up a new commitment transaction and have exchanged signatures.
In the real world one would argue that this contract is now valid.

[[routing-setup-htlc-5]]
.However Bob knows that Alice has to invalidate her previous commitment transaction which she does
image:images/routing-setup-htlc-5.png[]

Now Bob and Alice both have a new commitment transaction with and additional HTLC output and we have achieved a major step towards updating a payment channel.
The new Balance of Alice and Bob does not reflect yet that Alice has successfully send 15 mBTC to Bob.
However the hashed time locked contracts are now set up in a way that secure settlement in exchange for the proof of payment will be possible.
This yields another round of communication with Lightning messages and setting up additional commitment transactions which in case of good cooperation remove the outstanding HTLCs.
Interestingly enough the `commitment_signed` and `revoke_and_ack` mechanism that we described to add an HTLC can be reused to update the commitment transaction.

If Bob was the recipient of the 15 mBTC and knows the preimage to the payment hash Bob can settle the HTLCs by sending and `update_fulfill_htlc` Lightning message to Alice.
This message has the type 130 and only 3 data fields:

* [`channel_id`:`channel_id`]
* [`u64`:`id`]
* [`32*byte`:`payment_preimage`]

As other messages Bob uses the `channel_id` field to indicates for which channel he returns the preimage.
The htlc that is being removed is identified by the same `id` that was used to set up the HTLC in the commitment transaction initially.
You might argue that Alice would not need to know the id of the HTLC for which Bob releases the preimage as the preimage and payment hash could be unique.
However with this design the protocol supports that a payment channel has several htlcs with the same preimage but only settles one.
One could argue that this does not make too much sense and it is good to be critical but this is how the protocol is designed and what it supports.
Finally in the last field Bob provides the `payment_preimage` which Alice can check hashes to the payment hash.

[WARNING]
====
When designing, implementing or studying a protocol one should ask: Is it safe to this or that in this moment of the protocol and can this be abused. We discussed for example the messages that where necessary for an HTLC to become valid. We pointed out that Bob should not see the received HTLC as valid even though he already has a new commitment transaction with signatures and invalidated his old commitment transaction before Alice also revoked her old commitment transaction. We also saw that no one is able to mess with the protocol of setting up a commitment transaction as in the worst case the protocol could be aborted and any dispute could be resolved by the Bitcoin Network. In the same way we should ask ourselves is it safe for Bob to just send out and release the preimage even though neither he nor alice have created the new pair of commitment transactions in which the HTLCs are removed. It is important to take a short break and ask yourself if Bob will in any case be able to claim the funds from the HTLC if the preimage is correct?
====

It is safe for Bob to tell Alice the preimage.
Imagine Alice decides that she would not want to pay Bob anymore and does not respond anymore to create a new pair of commitment transactions with the removed HTLC and the Balance on Bob's end.
In that case Bob could just force close the channel and publish his latest version of the commitment transaction.
As the time lock of the HTLC is not over yet with an onchain success transaction Bob would be able to claim and settle his 15 mBTC as he is the only person who is able to spend the HTLC output in the commitment transaction.
The other way around meaning Bob and Alice would negotiate a new commitment transaction with the removed HTLC would never be save for Alice.
If the signatures for the new commitment transaction are exchanged Bob has received the money and could decide not to release the preimage.

[NOTE]
====
Isn't it remarkable that even though the process of exchanging funds for an preimage seems to be happening concurrently at the same moment in time in reality it is actually happening one step after another but in the right order.

=== Source based Onion Routing

So far you have learnt that payment channels can be connected to a network which can be utilized to send payment from one participant to another one through a path of payment channels.
You have seen that with the use of HTLCs the intermediary nodes along the path are not able to steal any funds that they are supposed to forward and you have also learnt how a node can set up and settle an HTLC.
While this is all great it leaves a couple of questions open:

- Who chooses the path?
- How is it decided which path is selected along which the HTLCs for a payment to be routed are set up?
- Which nodes will know about the path?

The short answer to the first questions is that only the sender decides which path to choose.
Despite the fact that the Lightning Network is currently running the second question is still not answered in an optimal way and became a serious research topic.
For now we will only say that in the standard case the sender more or less randomly selects and tries paths of channels until it is possible to send the amount along that selected path.
With multi path payments the sender can split the amount and use the same strategy with multiple paths.
More details will be discuss in the advanced section about path finding.
There we explore and explain the current approach which seems to work good enough most of the time.
You will also learn about potential improvements that are currently being researched in that chapter.

The short answer to the third question is that no other node in the network learns about this path.
Nodes along the path only learn on which channel they received a payment and on which channel they are supposed to forward it.
Neither do they know whether the peer on the receiving channel initiated the payment nor do they know whether the peer on the outgoing channel is the final recipient of the payment.
We expect you to be surprised that it is actually possible to create such an algorithm with modern cryptography.
This is why we will now devote quite some space to write and discuss about source based onion routing.
This technique is fundamentally different to the best effort routing approach that is implemented on the internet protocol.
Best effort routing is know to have poor privacy protection of the transfered data and needs end to end encryption on the upper layers to be secure.
As many upper layer protocols did not include end to end encryption we learnt from the Snoweden revelations that spying agencies have been massively collecting data that was transfered over the internet together with the meta data like IP addresses of senders and recipients.
To get rid of these problems the Lightning Network utilizes a sourced base onion routing based on the SPHINX Mix format.
The SHINX mix format was originally designed to allow email remails to offer the possibility to send an answer without creating a security threat of the remailer service being able to know who was communicating with whom.
In that sense and very roughly speaking the SPHINX Mix format can be compared with the onion routing that is well known from the TOR network.

[NOTE]
====
While the Lightning Network also uses an onion routing scheme it is actually very different to the onion routing scheme that is used in the TOR network.
The biggest difference is that TOR is being used for arbitrary data to be exchanged between two participants where on the Lightning Network the main use case is to pay people and transfer data that encodes monetary value.
On the Lightning Network there is no analogy to the exit nodes of the Tor Network which on the TOR network produce a security risk. Lightning user should still not get the impression that their data and information is perfectly secure. Knowing the announced  fee rates and CLTV deltas a node might be able to guess the destination of an onion.
In TOR the security can be compromised if all randomly chosen TOR hops are acting together. In Lightning the payment hash identifies a payment and thus not every node along the path needs to be compromised in order to attack the security.
On the TOR network nodes are basically connected via a full graph as every node could create an encrypted connection with every other node on top of the Internet Protocol almost instantaneously and at no cost. On the Lightning Network payments can only flow along existing payment channels. Removing and adding of those channels is a slow and expensive process as it requires onchain bitcoin transactions.
On the Lightning Network nodes might not be able to forward a payment package because they do not own enough funds on their side of the payment channel. On the other hand there are hardly any plausible reasons other then its wish to act maliciously why a TOR node might not be able to forward an onion.
Last but not least the Lightning Network can actually run on TOR.
This means that all connections of a node with its peers and the resulting communication will by obfuscated once more through the TOR network.

Lets stick to our example in which Alice still wants to tip Gloria and has decided to use the path via Bob and Wei.
We note that there might have been alternative paths from Alice to Gloria but for now we will just assume it is this path that Alice has decided to use.
You have already learnt that Alice needs to set up an HTLC with Bob via and `update_add_htlc` message.
As discussed the `update_add_htlc` message contains a data field of 1366 Bytes in length that is the onion package.
This onion contains all the information about the path that Alice intends to use to send the payment to Gloria.
However Bob who receives the onion cannot read all the information about the path as most of the onion is hidden from him through a sequence of encryptions.
The name onion comes from the analogy to an onion that consists of several layers. In our case every layer corresponds to one round of encryption.
Each round of encryption uses different encryption keys.
They are chosen by Alice in a way that only the rightful recipient of an onion can peel of (decrypt) the top layer of the onion.

For example after Bob received the onion from Alice he will be able to decrypt the first layer and he will only see the information that he is supposed to forward the onion to Wei by setting up an HTLC with Wei.
The HTLC with Wei should use the same Payment Hash as the receiving HTLC from Alice.
The amount of the forwarded HTLC was specified in Bob decrypted layer of the onion.
It will be slightly smaller than the amount of his incoming HTLC from Alice.
The difference of these two amounts has to be at least as big as to cover the routing fees that Bob's node announced earlier on the gossip protocol.

In order to set up the HTLC Bob will modify the onion a little bit.
He removes the information that he could read from it and passes it along to Wei.

Wei in turn is only able to see that he is supposed to forward the package to Gloria.
Wei knows he received the onion from Bob but has no clue that it was actually Alice who initiated the onion in the first place.
In this way every participant is only able to peel of one layer of the onion by decrypting it.
Each participant will only learn the information it has to learn to fulfill the routing request.
For example Bob will only know that Alice offered him an HTLC and sent him an onion and that he is supposed to offer an HTLC to Wei and forward a slightly modified onion.
Bob does not know if Alice is the originator of this payment as she could also just have forwarded the payment to him.
Due to the layered encryption he cannot see the inside of Wei's, and Gloria's layer.
Thus he cannot know that Gloria is the final destination of the payment. **TODO: Is this actually true, given the CLTV deltas?** )
The only thing Bob knows is that he was involved in a path that involved Alice, him and Wei.

While the Onion is decrypted layer by layer while it travels along the path from Alice via Bob and Wei to Gloria it is created from the inside layer to the outside layers via several rounds of encryption.
Being created from the inside means that the construction starts with the Onion Package that Gloria is supposed to receive in plain text.
Let us now look at the construction of the Onion that Alice has to follow and at the exact information that is being put inside each layer of the onion.

The onions are a data structure that at every hop consists of four parts:

1. The version byte
2. The header consisting of a public key that can be used by the recipient to produce the shared secret for decrypting the outer layer and to derive the public key that has to be put in the header of the modified onion for the next recipient.
3. The payload
4. an authentication via an HMAC.

For now we will ignore how the public keys are derived and exchanged and focus on the payload of the onion.
Only the payload is actually encrypted and will be peeled of layer by layer.
The payload consists of a sequence of a sequence of per hop data.
This data can come in two formats the legacy one and the Type Length Value (TLV) Format.
While the TLV format offers more flexibility in both cases the routing information that is encoded into the onion is the same for every but the last hop.
On the last hop the TLV information departs from the legacy information as it allows to include a preimage.
This is nice as it allow a payer to initiate a payment without the necessity to ask the payer for an invoice and payment hash first.
We will this feature called key send in a different chapter.

A node needs three pieces of information to forward the package:

1. The short channel id of the next channel along which it is supposed to forward the onion by setting up an HTLC with the same payment hash.
2. The amount that it is supposed to be forwarded and thus being used in the HTLC.
3. Timelock information encoded to a `cltv_delta` is the last piece of information that is needed as HTLCs are hashed time locked contracts.

For easier readability we have used just a small integer as `short_channel_ids` in the following example and graphics.

[[routing-onion-1]]
.`per_hop` payload of Glorias onion and the encrypted
image:images/routing-onion-1.png[]

We can see that Alice has created some per hop data for David.
The short channel id is set to 0 signaling David that this payment is intended to be for him.
The amount to forward is set to 3000.
On the incoming HTLCs David should have seen that exact amount.
Usually this amount is intended to say how many satoshis should be forwarded.
Since the short channel id was set to zero in this particular case it is interpreted as the payment amount.
Finally the CLTV delta which David should use to forward the payment is also set to zero as David is the final hop.
These data fields consist of 20 Bytes.
The Lightning Network protocol actually allows to store 65 Bytes of data the Onion for every hope.

- 1 Byte Realm which signals nodes how to decode the following 32 Bytes.
- 32 Byte for routing hints (20 of which we have already used).
- 32 Byte of a Hashed Message Authentication code.

Since the additional 12 Byte of data for the routing hints were not needed at this time they are set to zero.
In the next diagram we can see how the per hop payload for David looks like.

[[routing-onion-2]]
.`per_hop` payload of Glorias onion and the encrypted
image:images/routing-onion-2.png[]

On important feature to protect the privacy is to make sure that onions are always of equal length independ of their position along the payment path.
Thus onions are always expected to contain 20 entries of 65 Bytes with per hop data.
As David is the final recipient there is only reasonable data for 65 Bytes of the per hop data.
This is not a problem as the other 19 fields are filled with junk data.
You could also see this in the previous diagram.

After Alice has set all the data she needs to encrypt the onion payload.
For this she derives a shared secret between Davids public node key and the private secret that she generated for David.
This process is also well known as an Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellmann key exchange and a standard technique in cryptography and Bitcoin.

[[routing-onion-3]]
.`per_hop` payload of Glorias onion and the encrypted
image:images/routing-onion-3.png[]

You can see that Alice put the encrypted payload inside the full Onion Package which contains a the public keys from the secret key that she used to derive the shared secret.
Full onion package also has a version byte in the beginning and an HMAC for the entire Onion.
When David receives the Onion package he will extract the public key from the unencrypted part of the onion package.
The property of the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellmann key exchange is that if he multiplies this public key with his private node key he will get the same shared secret as a result as Alice did.
However others cannot derive the same shared secret as they neither know Alice's nor David's private key.

[NOTE]
====
Let `(d,D)` be the secret and Public key of David and let G be the generator point of the elliptic curve so that `D = d*G`.
Similarly let `(ek_d, EPK_D)` the ephemeral keys that Alice has generated for David such that the Public ephemeral Key `EPK_D = ek_d*G`.
Alice computed the shared secret as ss_`d =  ek_d*D`.
Using the definition of public keys this is the same as `ek_d*(d*G)=(ek_d*d)*G`.
Since multiplication with the generator point is a group homomorphism we can apply the law of associativity.
And because the secrets are just numbers modulo some prime we can change the order of the multiplication resulting in `ss_d = (d*ek_d)*G`.
With the same argument as before we apply the law of associativity and apply the definition of public keys resulting in `(d*ek_d)*G = d*(ek_d*G) = d*EPK_D`.
We just saw why `ek_d*D = d*EPK_D = ss_d` and why Alice and Davide will be able to derive the same shared secret if Alice puts the ephemeral public key inside the onion.
====

After the encrypted Onion for David is created Alice will create the next outer layer by creating the onion for Wei.

She truncates 65 Bytes from the end of the encrypted onion and prepends the truncated onion with 65 Byte per Hop data for Wei.
The per hop data follows the same structure as the per hop data for David.
Thus she starts with the Realm Byte that she will set to 0 again.
Then comes the short channel id.
This is set to 452 as Wei is supposed to use that channel to forward the onion.
She sets the amount to 3000 satoshi as this is the amount that David is supposed to receive.
Finally she uses the CLTV delta that was announced for this channel on the gossip protocol and that Wei should use for the HTLC when he forwards the Onion.
Again 12 Bytes of zeros are padded and an HMAC is computed.
Note that she did not have to compute filler this time as she already has too much data with the encrypted inner onion.
That is why the inner onion had to be truncated at the end.
This is the plain text version of Weis Onion payload and can be seen in the following diagram:

[[routing-onion-4]]
.`per_hop` payload of Glorias onion and the encrypted
image:images/routing-onion-4.png[]

We emphasize that Wei has no chance to decrypt the inner part of the onion.
However the information for Wei should also be protected from others.
Thus Alice conducts another ECDH.
This time with Wei's public key and and ephemeral keypair that she has generated particularly for Wei.
She uses the shared secret to encrypt the onion payload.
She would be able to construct the entire onion for Wei - which actually Bob does while he forwards the onion.
The Onion that Wei would receive can be seen in the following diagram:

[[routing-onion-5]]
.`per_hop` payload of Glorias onion and the encrypted
image:images/routing-onion-5.png[]

Note that in the entire onion there will be Wei's ephemeral public key.
David ephemeral public key is not stored anywhere in the onion.
Neither in the header, nor in the payload data.
However we have seen that David needed to have this key in the header of the Onion that he received.
Luckily the ephemeral keys that Alice used for the ECDH with David can be derived from the ephemeral key that she used for Wei.
Thus after Wei decrypts his layer he can use the shared secret and his ephemeral public key to derive the ephemeral public key that David is supposed to use and store it in the header of the Onion that he forwards to David.
The exact progress to generate the ephemeral keys for every hope will be explained at the very end of the chapter.
Similarly it is important to recognize that Alice removed data from the end of Davids onion payload to create space for the per hop data in Wei's onion.
Thus when Wei has received his onion and removed his routing hints and per hop data the onion would be to short and he somehow needs to be able to append the 65 Bytes of filled junk data in a way that the HMACs will still be valid.
This process is of filler generation as well as the process of deriving the ephemeral keys is described in the end of this chapter.
What is important to know is that every hope can derive the Ephemeral Public key that is necessary for the next hop and that the onions save space by always storing only one ephemeral key instead of all the keys for all the hops.


Finally after Alice has computed the encrypted version for Wei she will use the exact same process to compute the encrypted version for Bob.
For Bobs onion she actually computes the header and provides the ephemeral public key herself.
Note how Wei was still supposed to forward 3000 satoshis but How Bob was supposed to forward a different amount.
The difference is the routing fee for Wei.
Bob on the other hand will only forward the onion if the difference between the mount to forward and the HTLC that Alice sets up while transferring the Onion to him is large enough to cover for the fees that he would like to earn.

[NOTE]
====
We have not discussed the exact cryptographic algorithms and schemes that are being used to compute the ciphertext from the plain text.
Also we have not discussed how the HMACs are being computed at every step and how everything fits together while the Onions are always being truncated and modified on the outer layer.
If everything until here made perfect sense to you and you want to learn about those details we believe that you have all the necessary tools at hand to read BOLT 04 which is why we decided not to include all those technical details here in the book.
BOLT 04 is the open source specification of the onion routing scheme that is being used on the Lightning Network and a perfect resource for the missing details.

TODO: everything from here on will most likely change and could even be redundant.

Onions are being constructed from the inside to the outside.
As the inside of the onion is decrypted last it has to correspond to the recipient which in our case is Gloria.
As every layer of the Onion is encrypted by Alice in such a way that only the respective recipient can decrypt their layer Alice needs to come up with a sequence of encryption keys that she will use for each and every hop.
The main concept that is being used is the shared secret computation via an elliptic Curve Diffie Hellmann Key exchange (ECDH) between Alice and each of the hops.
However for the recipients to be able to to compute their shared secret they have to know a public key which they can use.
If Alice used the same private key for the computation of each of the shared secrets Alice would have to send the same public key with the onion.

the different payments could be linked together by an attacker that is why

Every layer of the onion has 32 Bytes of `per_hop` data.
This data is split into 4 data fields

- The 8 Byte `short_channel_id` indicates on which channel the onion should be forwarded next
- The 8 Bytes `amt_to_forward` is a 64 Bit unsigned integer that encodes an amount in millisatoshi and indicates the amount that is supposed to be forwarded
- The 4 Bytes `cltv_delta` is a 32 Bit unsigned integer that is used for the time locks in the HTLCs.
- Finally there are 12 Byte left for padding and future versions and updates of the onion package format.






[[routing-onion-6]]
.`per_hop` payload of Glorias onion and the encrypted
image:images/routing-onion-6.png[]


Interestingly enough Alice can construct the onion with different encryption keys for Bob, Wei and Gloria without the necessity to establish a peer connection with them.
She only needs a public key from each participant which is the public `node_id` of the lightning node and known to Alice.
As other nodes she has learnt about the existence of public payment channels and the public `node_id` of other participants via the gossip protocol which we described in its own chapter.
In order to have a different encryption key for every layer Alice produces a shared secret with each hop using the public `node_id` of each node and conduct an Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellmann Key exchange (ECDH).

She starts by generating a temporary session key.
This key will also be called the ephemeral key.
This private key multiplied with the generator Point of the Elliptic curve that is being used in Bitcoin produces a public key.
This happens in the same way how the nodes public key is generated from the secret private key of the node.
Alice could use this session keys to conduct the Diffie Hellmann key exchange if she would send the public key with the onion.
However she wishes to use a different session key to conduct the Diffie Hellmann key exchange with each of the nodes along the path.
**TODO**: WHY?!
Yet she does not want to add a public key (which consumes quite some space) into every layer of the onion.
Luckily there is a nice deterministic way in which she can derive different sessions keys for every hop and execute the Diffie Hellmann and allow the hops to use their shared secret to derive the next session public key.
Lets explore this in detail with the following example:


[Note]
====
Of course the Lightning Network protocol could have been designed in a way that Alice will only use her node's key to conduct the ECDH with every nodes public key.
However she would have to put her public key in the header of the onion.
This is necessary for nodes to be able to execute an ECDH and produce the same shared secret that Alice used for the respective layer of the Onion.
However with that information nodes would know that Alice was the originator of the payment lifting the anonymity of the payer by design.

===== CLTV expiry and deltas

==== Pitfalls with source based Routing and HTLCs

In the first part of the routing chapter you have learnt that payments securely flow through the network via a path of HTLCs.
You saw how a single HTLC is negotiated between two peer and added to the commitment transaction of each peer.
In the second part you have seen how the necessary information for setting up HTLCs along a path of hops are being transfered via onions from the source to the sender.
A mechanism that protects the privacy of payer and payee.
However there are quite some challenges and things that can go not as expected.
This is why we we want to discuss how errors are being handled and what users and developers should take into consideration.

Most importantly it is absolutely necessary that you understand that once your node sent out an onion on your behalf (most likely because you wanted to pay someone) Everything that happens to the onion is now out of your control.

* You cannot force nodes to forward the onion immediately.
* You cannot force nodes to send back an error if they cannot forward the onion because of missing liquidity or other reasons.
* You cannot be sure that the recipient has the preimage to the payment hash or releases it as soon as the HTLCs of the correct amount arrived.

By setting up an HTLC - which you do by sending out an onion - you have committed to settle the HTLCs in exchange for the preimage if the preimage arrives before the absolute timelock of the HTLC.
This can be very frustrating from a use experience point of view.
You want to quickly pay a person but the payment path that your node choose has CLTV deltas that quickly add up to several 100 blocks which is a couple of days.
This means now that if nodes on the path misbehave - on purpose or maybe just because they have a downtime which your node didn't know about - you will have to wait even though you don't see a preimage.
You must not send out another onion along a different path because there is a risk that both payments will settle eventually.
While our user experience is that most payments find a path and settle in far less than 10 seconds the Lightning Network protocol cannot and does not give any service level agreement that within this time payments will settle or fail.

[NOTE]
====
There are ideas out that might solve this issue to some degree by allowing the payer to abort a payment. You can find more about that under the terms `cancelable payments` or `stuckless payments`. However the proposals that exist only reverse the problem as now the sender can misbehave and the recipient looses control. Another solution is to use many paths in a multipath payment and include some redundancy and ignore the problem that a path takes longer to complete.
====

Despite these principle problems there are plausible situations in which the routing process fails and in which honest nodes can and should react.
This is why the onion protocol has the ability to send back errors.
Some - but not all - of the reasons for errors could be:

* A node has not enough liquidity to set up the next HTLC
* The next payment channel does not exist anymore as it might have been closed while the onion was routed to node that was supposed to forward the onion along the channel.
* While the channel might still be open - as the funding transaction was never spent - it might happen that the other peer is offline. This of course prevents the node to forward the onion.
* The key exchanges of the sender might have been wrong so the decryption of the onion or the HMCAs do not match. (also because someone tried to tamper with the onion)
* The recipient might not have issued an invoice and does not know the payment details.
* The amount of the final HTLC is too low and the recipient does not want to release the preimage.

If errors like those occur a node should send back a reply onion.
The reply onion will be encrypted at each hop with the same shared secrets that have been used to construct the onion or decrypt a layer.
These shared keys are all known to the originator of the payment.
The onion innermost onion contains the error message and an HMAC for the error message.
The process makes sure that the sender of the onion and recipient of the reply can be sure that the error really originated from the node that the error messages says.
Another important step in the process of handling errors is to abort the routing process.
We discussed that the sender of a payment cannot just remove the HTLC on the channel along which the sender sent the payment.
Recall for example the situation in which Alice sent and onion to Bob who set up an HTLC with Wei.
If Alice wanted to remove the HTLC with Bob this would put a financial risk on Bob.
He fears that his HTLC with Wei still might be fulfilled meaning that he could not claim the reimbursement from Alice.
Thus Bob would never agree to remove the HTLC with Alice unless he already has removed his HTLC with Wei.
If however the HTLC between Alice and Bob are set up and the HTLC between Bob and Wei are set up but Wei encounters problems with forwarding the onion it is perfectly Wei has more options than Alice.
While sending back the error Onion to Bob Wei could ask him to remove the HTLC.
Bob has no risk in removing the HTLC with Wei and Wei also has no risk as there is no downstream HTLC.
Removing an HTLC is happening very similar to adding HTLCs.
Due to the just presented argument only peers who have accepted an offered HTLC can initiate the removal of HTLCs.
In the case of errors peers signals that they wish to remove the HTLC by sending an `update_fail_htlc` or `update_fail_malformed_htlc` message.
These messages contain the id of an HTLC that should be removed in the next version of the commit transaction.
In the same handshake like process that was used to exchange `commitment_signed` and `revoke_and_ack` messages the new state and thus pair of commitment signatures has to be negotiated and agreed upon.
This also means while the balance of a channel that was involved in a failed routing process will not have changed at the end it will have negotiated two new commitment transactions.
Despite having the same balance it must not got back to the previous commitment transaction which did not include the HTLC as this commitment transaction was revoked.
If it was used to force close the channel the channel partner would have the ability to create a penalty transaction and get all the funds.

==== Settling HTLCs
In the last section you you understood the error cases that can happen with onion routing via the chain of HTLCs.
You have learnt how HTLCs are removed if there is an error.
Of course HTLCs also need to be removed and the balance needs to be updated if the chain of HTLCs was successfully set up to the destination and the preimage is being released.
Not surprisingly this process is initiated with anther lightning message called `update_fulfill_htlc`.
You will remember that HTLCs are set up and supposed to be removed with a new balance for the recipient in exchange for a secret `preimage`.
Recalling the complex protocol with `commitment_signed` and `revoke_and_ack` messages you might wonder how to make this exchange `preimage` for new state atomic.
The cool thing is it doesn't have to be.
Once a channel partner with an accepted incoming HTLC knows the preimage can savely just pass it to the channel partner.
That is why the `update_fulfill_htlc` message contains only the `channel_id` the `id` of the HTLC and the `preimage`.
You might wonder that channel partner could now refuse to sign a new channel state by sending `commitment_siged` and `revoke_and_ack` messages.
This is not a problem though.
In that case the recipient of the offered HTLC can just go on chain by force closing the channel.
Once that has happened the preimage can be used to claim the HTLC output.

==== Some Considerations for routing nodes
Accepting and HTLC removes funds from a peer that the peer cannot utilize unless the HTLC is removed due to success or failure.
Similarly forwarding an HTLC binds some funds from your nodes payment channel until the HTLC is being removed again.
As we explained in the very beginning of the chapter engaging into the forwarding process of HTLCs does neither yield a direct risk to loose funds nor does it gain the chance to gain funds.
However the funds in jeopardy could be locked for some time.
In the worst case the routing process needs to be resolved on chain as the payment channel was forced close due to some other circumstances.
In that case outstanding HTLCs produce additional onchain food print and costs.
Thus there are two small economic risks involved with the participation in the routing process.

. Higher onchain fees in case of forced channel closes due to the higher footprint of HTLCs
. Opportunity costs of locked funds. While the HTLC is active the funds cannot be used otherwise.

In economics and financial mathematics the idea to pay another person that takes a risk is widely spread and seems reasonable.
Owners of routing nodes might want to monitor the routing behavior and opportunities and compare them to the onchain costs and the opportunity costs in order to compute their own routing fees that they wish to charge to accept and forward HTLCs.

Also one should notice that HTLCs are outputs in the commitment transaction.
Lightning network protocol allows users to pay a single satoshi.
However it is impossible to set up HTLCs for this amount.
The reason is that the corresponding outputs in the commitment transaction would be below the dust limit.
Such cases are solved in practice with the following trick:
Instead of setting up an HTLC the amount is taken from the output of the sender but not added to the output of the recipient.
Thus the HTLCs which are below the dust limit can understood as additional fees in the commitment transaction.
Most Lightning Nodes support the configuration of minimum accepted HTLC values.
Operators have to consider if they want to risk overpaying fees or loosing funds in the forced channel close cases because the commitment transactions have been added to the fees.
