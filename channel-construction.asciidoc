Payment channels are the core and most fundamental building block of the Lightning Network.
Of course, every detail of a technology exists for a reason and is important.
However the Lightning Network is literally built around the idea and concept of payment channels.
In the previous chapters you have already learned that payment channels

* allow two peers who created it to send and receive Bitcoin up to the amount specified by the capacity of the channel as often as they want to.
* split the capacity of the channel into a balance between the two peers which - as long as the channel is open is only known by the owners of the channel and increases privacy.
* do not require peers to do any additional onchain transactions other than the one needed to open and - potentially at a later state - to close the channel.
* can stay open for an arbitrary time. Potentially in the best case forever.
* do not require peers to trust each other as any attempt by a peer to cheat would enable the other peer to receive all the funds in the channel as a panality.
* can be connected to a network and allow peers to send money a long a path of connected channels without the necessity to trust the intermediary nodes as they have no ability to steal the Bitcoin that are being forwarded.
* 

In this chapter we will dig deeper into the protocol details that are needed to open and close payment channels.
Working through this rather technical chapter you will be able to understand how the protocol design achieves the properties of payment channels.
Where necessary some information from the first chapters of this book will be repeated.
If you are new to the topic we highly encourage you to start there first.
If you however already know a fair share about bitcoin script, OP_CODES and protocol design it might be sufficient to skip the previous chapter and start here with us.
This books follows the construction of payment channels as described in BOLT 02 which is titled `peer protocol` and describes how two peers communicate to open, maintain and close a channel.
There will be one big difference though.
We will only discuss opening and closing a channel.
The operation and maintainance of a channel which means either making or forwarding a payment is discussed in our chapter about routing.
Also other constructions of payment channels are known and being discussed by the developers.
Historically speaking these are the Duplex Micropayment channels introduced by Christian Decker during his time as a PhD student at ETH Zuric and the eltoo channels which where also introduced by Christian Decker.
The eltoo channels are certainly a more elgant and cleaner why of achieving payment channels with the afore mentioned properties.
However they require the activation of BIP 118 and a softfork and are - at the time of writing - a potential future protocol change.
Thus this chapter will only focus on the pentalty based channels as described in the Lightning Network Whitepaper and specified in BOLT 02 which are currently supported by the protocol and the implementations.

[NOTE]
====
The Lightning Network does not need consensus of features across it's participants.
If the Bitcoin Softfork related to BIP 118 activates and people implement eltoo channels nodes that support eltoo can create payment channels and the onion routing of payments a long a path of channels would work just fine even if some of the channels are the modern eltoo channels or some channels are the legacy channels.
Actually when Lightning network connections are established nodes signal feature bits of global and local features that they support.
Thus havning the ability to create eltoo channels would just be an additional feature bit.
In this sense upgrading the Lightnign Network is much easier than upgrading Bitcoin where consensus among all stakeholders is needed.

Let's quickly summarize what you should already know about payment channels on a technical level and for what you will learn the details in this chapter.
A payment channel is encoded as an unspent 2 - of - 2 multisignature transaction output.
The capacity of the channel relates to the amount that is bound to the unspent 2 - of - 2 multisignature transaction output.
It is opened with the help of a funding transaction that sends bitcoin to a 2 - of - 2 multisignature output together with a communication protocol that helps to initialize and maintain its state.
The balance of the channel encodes how the capacity is split between the two peers who maintain the channel.
Technically the balance is encoded by a the most recent pair of a sequence of pairs of similar (but not equal) presigned commitment transactions.
These commitment transactions should never hit the blockchain and serve as a safty net for the participants in case the channel partner becomes unresponsive of disappears.
They are also the reason why the Lightning Network is called an offchain scaling solution.
Each channel partner has both signatures for one of the commitment transactions from the sequence of pairs.
The split of the capacity is realized by a `to_local` and a `to_remote` output that is part of every commitment transaction.
The `to_local` output goes to an address that is controlled by the peer that holds this fully signed commitment transaction.
`to_local` outputs, which also exist in the second stage HTLC transactions - which we discuss in the routing chapter - have two spending conditions.
The `to_local` output can be spent either at any time with the help of a revocation secrete or after a timelock with the secret key that is controlled by the peer holding this commitment transaction.
The revocation secrete is necessary to economically disincentivice peers to publish previous commitment transactions.
Addresses and revokation secretes change with every new pair of commitment transactions that are being negotiated.
The Lightning Network as a protocol defines the communication protocols that are necessary to achieve this.

### Security of a Payment channel
While the BOLTs introduce payment channels directly with the opening protocol we have decided to talk about the security model first.
The security of payment channels come through a penalty based revocation system which help two parties to split the capacity of the payment channel into a balance sheet without the necessity to trust each other.
In this chapter we start from an insecure approach of creating a payment channel and explain why it is insecure.
We will then explain how time locks are being used to create revokable sequence maturity contracts that create the penality based revokation system which economically incentivizes people maintain the most recent state.
After you understood these concepts we will quickly walk you through the technical details of opening and closing a channel.

Any known payment channel constuction uses a 2 - of - 2 multisgnature output as the basis of the payment channel.
We call the amount that is attached to this output the capacity of the channel.
In every case Both channel partners hold 1 secret key of the multisignature address which means that they can only collaboratively controll the funds.

#### An example for a highly insecure payment channel construction
Let us assume Alice does not know the details about the Lightning Network and tries to naivly open a payment channel in a way that leads to her most likely loosing her funds.
Alice has heard that Payment channel are 2 - of - 2 multisnature outputs.
As she wants to have a channel with Bob and since she knows a public key from Bob she decides to open a channel by sending money to a 2 - of - 2 multisignature address that comes from Bob's and her key.
We call the Transaction that Alices used a **funding transaction** as it is supposed to fund the payment channel.
However signing and broadcasting this funding transaction would be a huge mistake.
As we have discussed the Bitcoins from the resulting UTXO can only be spent if Alice and Bob work together and both provide a signature for a transaction spending thos coins. 
If Bob would not respond to Alice in future Alice would have lost her Bitcoins forever.
That is because the coins would be stuck in the 2 - of - 2 multisignature address to which she has just sent them.

Luckily Alice has previously read Mastering Bitcoin and she knows all the properties of Bitcoin script and is aware of the risks that are involved to sending Bitcoins to a 2 - of - 2 multisignature address to which she does not controll both keys.
She is also aware of the "Don't trust. Verify" principle that Bitcoiners follow and doesn't want to trust Bob to help her moving or accessing her coins.
She would much more prefere to keep control over her coins even though they shall be stored in this 2 - of - 2 multisnature address.
While this seems like an impossible problem Alice has an idea:

    What if she could already prepare a refund transaction (which we call commitment transaction in future) that sends all the bitcoin back to an address that she controlls?

Before broadcasting her funding transaction she already prepares and finnishes it so that she knows the transaction id.
She can now create the commitment transaction that spends the output of the funding transaction and ask Bob to provide a signature.
At that time Bob has nothing to loose by signing the commitment transaction.
He did not have Coins at the multisig address anyway.
Even if he did Alice intends to spend from an output which Bob never was involved in.
Thus at that point for Bob it is perfectly reasonable to sign the commitment transaction that spends the funding transaction.
On the other side you as a reader might think:

Why would Alice send money to a multisignature address just to prepare a transaction that sends the money back to her? 

We really hope you have wondered about this because this is really the point where the innovation begins.
Just because in general people are expected to broadcast a transaction to the bitcoin network as soon as they have signed it noone forcses you to do that.
Instead of braodcasting the commitment transaction together with the funding transaction she will send out the funding transaction and keep the commitment transaction at a save place.

TODO: talk about segwit here? 

[NOTE]
====
This entire process might be surprising (... comparison with HTTP server push and AJAX...)

====

So the main question is:

    What can go wrong with the insecure payment channel? 


As Alice would loose access of her Bitcoins once she sends it to a 2 - of - 2 multisignature output for which she only controlls one key she needs to make sure that she will be able to regain access of her coins in case Bob becomes unresponisive. 
Thus before Alice publishes the funding transaction she will create another transaction that sends all the bitcoin from the 2 - of - 2 multisignature output back to an address which she controlls. 

.The situation can be seen in the following picture
image:channel-construction-opening-1.png[]
Of course for the commitment transaction Alice would need to get a Signature from Bob

[NOTE]
====
Commitment transactions fulfill three purposes:
1. refund channel participants in case the other side becomes irresponsive
2. Splite the capacity of the channel into the current balance that peers have agreed upon.
3. Allow revocation of old state through the means of a penality via a revocable sequence maturity contract.

### Opening a payment channel
We call the process of creating a new payment channel "opening a payment channel".
Currently a payment channel can only exists between exactly two peers.
Therefore you might be surprised to learn that even though two users are owning and maintaining the channel the current construction requires only one user to open the channel.
This does not mean that only one peer is needed to open a channel.
It does however mean that the user who opens the channel also has to provide the bitcoins to fund the channel.

Let us stick to our example where Alice opens a channel with Bob with a capacity of 100k satoshi.
This means that Alice provides 100k satoshi.
Alice will do that by creating a so called funding transaction.
This transaction sends 100k satoshi from an address that she - or her lightning node software controlls - to a 2 - of - 2 multisig address for which she and Bob know 1 secret key each. 
The amount of Bitcoin that is sent to the multisig output by Alice is called the capacity of the payment channel.
Thus for the reminder of the chapter in all examples we assume the payment channels that we use as examples already magically exist and the two peers Alice and Bob already have all the necessary data at hand.

[NOTE]
====
Even though Alice and Bob both have a public node key to which they own the private secret opening a payment channel is not as easy as sending bitcoins to the 2 out of 2 multisignature output that belongs to the public keys of Alice and Bob.
Let us assume for a moment that Alice would send 100k Satoshi to the Multisig address resulting from hers and Bob's public node id.
In that case Alice will never be able to maintain her funds back without the help of Bob.
Of course we want our payment channels to work in a way that Alice does not need to trust Bob. 
Bob could however refuse to sign a transaction that sends all those outputs back to an address that is controlled by Alice.
He would be able to blackmail Alice to assign a significant amount of those Bitcoin to an output address that is controlled by him.
Thus Bob can't steel the coins from Alice directly but he can threten Alice to have her coins lost forever.
This example shows that unfortunatelly opening a channel will be a little bit more complex than just sending Bitcoins to a multisignature address.

[NOTE]
====
The importance of the segwit upgrade.


====



In order to avoid the reuse of addresses Alice and Bob will generate a new set of keys for the multisig address that they use to open the channel.
Alice needs to inform Bob which key she intends to use for their channel and ask him which key he intends to use.
She will do that by sending Bob and `open_channel` message signaling her interest to open a channel.
This message contains a lot of additional data fields.
Most of them specify meta data which is necessary for the channel operation and can be be safely ignored for now.
We will only look at the following ones: 

* [chain_hash:chain_hash]
* [32*byte:temporary_channel_id]
* [u64:funding_satoshis]
* [point:funding_pubkey]
* [point:revocation_basepoint], [point:payment_basepoint], [point:delayed_payment_basepoint], [point:htlc_basepoint], [point:first_per_commitment_point]

With the `chain_hash` Alice signals that she intends to open the channel on the Bitcoin blockchain.
While the Lightning Network was certainly invented to scale the amount of payments that can be conducted on the Bitcoin Network it is interesting to note that the Network is designed in a way that allows to build channels over various currencies.
If a node has channels with more than one currency it is even possible to route payments through multi asset channels.
However this turns out to be a little bit tricky in reality as the exchange rate between currencies might change which might lead the forwarding node to wait for a better ex hange rate to settle or to abort the payment process.
For the opening process the final channel id cannot be determined yet thus Alice needs to select a random channel id which Bob and she can use to identify the messages for this channel during the opening phase.
This design descision allows multiple channels to exist between two nodes - though currently only LND supports this feature.
Alice tells Bob for how many satoshis she wishes to open the channel.
This information is necessary to construct the commitment transaction ...


Once the channel is open Alice will be able to send 99k satoshi along this channel.
Bob on the other side will be able to receive 99k satoshi along that channel.
This means that initially Alice will not be able to recieve Bitcoins on this channel and that Bob initially will not be able to send Bitcoin along that channel.


[NOTE]
====
The current construction could be generalized to multiparty channels and channel factories.
However the communication protocol would suffer from increased complexity.
