[[ch02_getting_started]]
== Getting Started

// TODO intro paragraph - no empty headings!

==== Choosing a Lightning Network Wallet

* full nodes (c-lightning, eclair, lnd) + remote controls
* phone / desktop wallets (SPV clients)
* custodial services / wallets?
// Mastering bitcoin also had a section about custodial web wallets. So it might be fair to include them.

==== Quick Start

* We start with a mobile wallet like eclair
* Verify the authenticity of the software (e.g. App store / Acinq website / github)
** discuss that a general phising scheme might consist of tricking you to download a similar looking software

[[getting_first_bitcoin]]
==== Getting Your First Bitcoin on the Lightning Network

* Trade fiat for Bitcoin (as in Mastering Bitcoin)

[[using_own_bitcoin]]
==== Process for people who already own Bitcoin ====

* send bitcoin to lightning wallet (1 onchain transaction - soon nodes / wallets may support funding a channel directly without sending bitcoin to the lightning network wallet first)
* find a node to open a channel with (Node explorer / Autopilots / ...)
* open a connection
* open a channel
* wait confirmations for the channel to become operational

[[sending_receiving]]
==== Sending and Receiving Bitcoin on the Lightning Network
* have the person who helps onbording open a payment channel (As complex as a bitcoin transaction)
* showcase how the funds now can be send back and forth
** create invoice
** decode invoice (do always before paying!)
** pay an invoice
* showcase how an arbitrary invoice can be paid e.g. https://voting.ln.rene-pickhardt.de
