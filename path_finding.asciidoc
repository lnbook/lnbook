== Path Finding and Payment Delivery

Payment delivery on the Lightning Network depends on finding a path from the sender to the recipient, a process called _path finding_.

=== Path finding in the Lightning protocol suite

Path finding, path selection, multi-path payments (MPP) and the payment attempt trial & error loop occupy the majority of the "Payment Layer" at the top of the protocol suite.

These components are highlighted by a double outline in the protocol suite, shown in <<LN_protocol_pathfinding_highlight>>:

==== Where is the BOLT?

So far we've looked at several technologies that are part of the Lightning Network and we have seen their exact specification as part of a BOLT standard. You may be surprised to find that path finding is not part of the BOLTs!

That's because path finding isn't an activity that requires any form of coordination or interoperability between different implementations. As we've seen, the path is selected by the sender. Even though the routing details are specified in detail in the BOLTs, the path discovery and selection are left entirely up to the sender. So each node implementation can choose a different strategy/algorithm to find paths. In fact, the different node/client and wallet implementations can even compete and use their path finding algorithm as a point of differentiation.

=== Path finding: what problem are we solving?

The term path finding may be somewhat misleading, because it implies a search for _a single path_ connecting two nodes. In the beginning, when the Lightning Network was small and not well interconnected, the problem was indeed about finding a way to join payment channels to reach the recipient.

But, as the Lightning Network has grown explosively, the path finding problem's nature has shifted. In mid-2021, as we finish this book, the Lightning Network consists of 20,000 nodes connected by at least 55,000 public channels with an aggregate capacity of almost 2,000 BTC. A node has on average 8.8 channels, while the top 10 most connected nodes have between 400 and 2000 channels _each_. A visualization of just a small subset of the Lightning Network channel graph (as of July 2021) is shown in <<lngraph>>:

If the sender and recipient are connected to other well-connected nodes and have at least one channel with adequate capacity - there will be thousands of paths. The problem becomes: selecting the _best_ path that will succeed in payment delivery, out of a list of thousands of possible paths.

==== Selecting the best path

To select the "best" path, we have to first define what we mean by "best". There may be many different criteria such as:

* Paths with enough liquidity. Obviously if a path doesn't have enough liquidity to route our payment, then it is not a suitable path.

* Paths with low fees. If we have several candidates, we may want to select ones with lower fees.

* Paths with short timelocks. We may want to avoid locking our funds for too long and therefore select paths with shorter timelocks.

All of these criteria may be desirable to some extent and selecting paths that are favorable across many dimensions is not an easy task. Optimization problems like this may be too complex to solve for the "best" solution, but often can be solved for some approximation of the optimal. Which is good news, because otherwise path finding would be an intractable problem.


==== Path finding in math and computer science

Path finding in the Lightning Network falls under a general category of _graph theory_ in mathematics and the more specific category of _graph traversal_ in computer science.

A network such as the Lightning Network can be represented as a mathematical construct called a _graph_, where _nodes_ are connected to each other by _edges_ (equivalent to the payment channels). The Lightning Network forms a _directed graph_ because the nodes are linked _asymmetrically_, since the channel balance is split between the two channel partners and the payment liquidity is different in each direction. A directed graph with numerical capacity constrains on its edges is called a _flow network_, a mathematical construct used to optimize transportation and other similar networks. Flow networks can be used as a framework when solutions need to achieve a specific flow while minimizing cost, known as the Minimum Cost Flow Problem (MCFP)_.

==== Capacity, balance, liquidity

In order to better understand the problem of transporting satoshis from point A to point B, we need to better define three important terms: capacity, balance, and liquidity. We use these terms to describe a payment channel's ability to route a payment.

In a payment channel connecting A<-->B:

Capacity:: This is the aggregate amount of satoshis that were funded into the 2-of-2 multisig with the funding transaction. It represents the maximum amount of value is held in the channel. The channel capacity is announced by the gossip protocol and is known to nodes.

Balance:: This is the amount of satoshis held by each channel partner that can be sent to the other channel partner. A subset of the balance of A, can be sent in the direction (A--->B) towards node B. A subset of the balance of B can be sent in the opposite direction (A<---B).

Liquidity:: The available (subset) balance that can actually be sent across the channel in one direction. Liquidity of A is equal to the balance of A minus the channel reserve and any pending HTLCs committed by A.

The only value known to the network (via gossip announcements) is the aggregate capacity of the channel. Some unknown portion of that capacity is distributed as each partners balance. Some subset of that balance is available to send across the channel in one direction:

----
capacity = balance(A) + balance(B)
liquidity(A) = balance(A) - channel_reserve(A) - pending_HTLCs(A)
----

==== Uncertainty of balances

If we knew the exact channel balances of every channel, we could compute one or more payment paths using any of the standard path finding algorithms taught in good computer science programs. But we don't know the channel balances, we only know the aggregate channel capacity, which is advertised by nodes in channel announcements. In order for a payment to succeed, there must be adequate balance on the sending side of the channel. If we don't know how the capacity is distributed between the channel partners, we don't know if there is enough balance in the direction we are trying to send the payment.

Balances are not announced in channel updates for two reasons: privacy and scalability. First, announcing balances would reduce the privacy of the Lightning Network as it would allow surveillance of payment by statistical analysis of the changes in balances. Second, if nodes announced balances (globally) with every payment, the Lightning Network's scaling would be as bad as that of on-chain Bitcoin transactions which are broadcast to all participants. Therefore, balances are not announced. To solve the path finding problem in the face of uncertainty of balances, we need innovative path finding strategies. These strategies must relate closely to the routing algorithm that is used, which is source-based onion-routing where it is the responsibility of the sender to find a path through the network.

The uncertainty problem can be described mathematically as a _range of liquidity_, indicating the lower and upper bounds of liquidity based on the information that is known. Since we know the capacity of the channel and we know the channel reserve balance (the minimum allowed balance on each end), the liquidity can be defined as:

----
min(liquidity) = channel_reserve
max(liquidity) = capacity - channel_reserve
----

Our channel liquidity uncertainty range is the range between the minimum and maximum possible liquidity. This is unknown to the network, except the two channel partners. However, as we will see we can use failed HTLCs returned from our payment attempts to update our liquidity estimate and reduce uncertainty. If for example we get an HTLC failure code that tells us that a channel cannot fulfill an HTLC that is smaller than our estimate for maximum liquidity, that means the maximum liquidity can be updated to the amount of the failed HTLC. In simpler terms, if we think the liquidity can handle an HTLC of N satoshis and we find out it fails to deliver M satoshis (where M is smaller), then we can update our estimate to M-1 as the upper bound. We tried to find the ceiling and bumped against it, so it's lower than we thought!

==== Path finding complexity

Finding a path through a graph is a problem modern computers can solve rather efficiently.
Developers mainly choose breadth-first search if the edges are all of equal weight.
In cases where the edges are not of equal weight, an algorithm based on Dijkstra Algorithm is used, such as A* ("a-star") or
In our case the weights of the edges can represent the routing fees.
Only edges with a capacity larger than the amount to be sent will be included in the search.
In this basic form, path finding in the Lightning network is very simple and straight forward.

However, channel liquidity is unknown to the sender. This turns our easy theoretical computer science problem into a rather complex real-world problem.
We now have to solve a path finding problem with only partial knowledge.
For example, we suspect which edges might be able to forward a payment because their capacity seems big enough.
But we can't be certain unless we try it out or ask the channel owners directly.
Even if we were able to ask the channel owners directly, their balance might change by the time we have asked others, computed a path, constructed an onion and send it along.
Not only do we have limited information but the information we have is highly dynamic and might change at any point in time without our knowledge.

==== Keeping it simple

The path finding mechanism implemented in Lightning nodes is to first create a list of candidate paths, filtered and sorted by some function. Then, the node or wallet will probe paths (by attempting to deliver a payment) in a trial-and-error loop until a path is found that successfully delivers the payment.

[NOTE]
====
This probing is done by the Lightning node or wallet and is not directly observed by the user of the software.
However, the user might suspect that probing is taking place if the payment is not completed instantly.
====

While "blind probing" is not optimal and leaves ample room for improvement, it should be noted that even this simplistic strategy works surprisingly well for smaller payments and well-connected nodes.

Most Lightning node and wallet implementation improve on this approach, by ordering/weighting the list of candidate paths. Some implementations order the candidate paths by cost (fees), or some combination of cost/capacity.

=== Path finding and payment delivery process

Path finding and payment delivery involves several steps, which we list below. Different implementations may use different algorithms and strategies, but the basic steps are likely to be very similar:

* Create a _channel graph_ from announcements and updates, containing the capacity of each channel.

* Filter the graph ignoring any channels with insufficient capacity for the amount we want to send.

* Find paths connecting the sender to the recipient.

* Order the paths by some weight (this may be part of the previous step's algorithm).

* Try each path in order until payment succeeds. (the trial-and-error loop)

* Optionally use the HTLC failure returns to update our graph, reducing uncertainty

We can group these steps into three primary activities:

1. Channel graph construction
2. Path finding (filtered and ordered by some heuristics)
3. Payment attempt(s)

These three activities can be repeated in a _payment round_ if we use the failure returns to update the graph, or if we are doing multi-path payments (see <<mpp>>).

In the next sections we will look at each of these steps in more detail, as well as more advanced payment strategies.

==== Channel graph construction

In <<gossip>> we explain the three main messages that nodes "gossip": +node_announcement+, +channel_announcement+, and +channel_update+. These three messages allow any node to gradually construct a "map" of the Lightning Network in the form of a _channel graph_. Each of these messages provides a critical piece of information for the channel graph:

node_announcement:: This contains the information about a node on the Lightning Network, such as its node ID (public key), network address (e.g. IPv4/6 or Tor), capabilities/features etc.

channel_announcement:: This contains the capacity and channel ID of a public (announced) channel between two nodes and proof of the channel's existence and ownership.

channel_update:: This contains a node's fee and timelock (CLTV) expectations for routing an outgoing (from that node's perspective) payment over a specified channel.

In terms of a mathematical graph, the node_announcement is the information needed to create the nodes or _vertices_ of the graph. The channel_announcement allows us to create the _edges_ of the graph representing the payment channels. Since each direction of the payment channel has its own balance, we create a directed graph. The channel_update allows us to incorporate fees and timelocks to set the _cost_ or _weight_ of the graph edges.

Depending on the algorithm we will use for path finding, we may establish a number of different cost functions for the edges of the graph.

For now, let's ignore the cost function and simply establish a channel graph showing nodes and channels, using the node_announcement and channel_announcement messages.

In this example, Selena is constructing a channel graph. Selena will use her channel graph to find a path to send a payment to Rashid. This is _Selena's channel graph_. There is no such thing as *the* channel graph, there is only ever *a channel graph* and it is always from the perspective of the node that has constructed it (see <<map_territory_relation>>).

[[map_territory_relation]]
.The map-territory relation
****
From Wikipedia's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation[_Map Territory Relation_], "The map–territory relation describes the relationship between an object and a representation of that object, as in the relation between a geographical territory and a map of it."

The map territory relation is best illustrated in "Sylvie and Bruno Concluded", a short story by Lewis Carroll which describes a fictional map that is 1:1 scale of the territory it maps, therefore having perfect accuracy but becoming completely useless as it would cover the entire territory if unfolded.

What does this mean for the Lightning Network? LN is the territory, and a channel graph is a map of that territory:

While we could imagine a theoretical (Platonic ideal) channel graph that represents the complete, up-to-date map of the Lightning Network, such a map is simply the Lightning Nwtwork itself. Each node has its own channel graph which is constructed from announcements and is necessarily incomplete, incorrect, and out-of-date!

The map can never completely and accurately describe the territory.
****

Selena listens to node_announcement messages and discovers 4 other nodes (in addition to Rashid, the intended recipient). The resulting graph represents a network of six nodes: (S)elena and (R)ashid are the (S)ender and (R)ecipient respectively; (A)lice, (B)ob, (X)avier and (Y)an are intermediary nodes. Selena's initial graph is just a list of nodes, shown in <<channel_graph_nodes>>:

Selena also receives seven channel_announcement messages with the corresponding channel capacities, allowing her to construct a basic "map" of the network, shown in <<channel_graph_1>>, below:

===== Uncertainty in the channel graph

As you can see from <<channel_graph_1>>, Selena does not know any of the balances of the channels. Her initial channel graph contains the highest level of uncertainty.

But wait: Selena does know *some* channel balances! She knows the balances of the channels that her own node has connected with other nodes. While this does not seem like much, it in fact very important information for constructing a path - Selena knows the actual liquidity of her own channels. Let's update the channel graph to show this information. We will use a "?" symbol to represent the unknown balances, as shown in <<channel_graph_2>>:
