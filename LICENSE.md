## Translations and Derivatives (eg. PDF, HTML, EPUB ebooks)

The current license does **not permit derivative or commercial work**. This means, it does **not** permit independent translations without pemission/license from O'Reilly Media (publisher). It also does not permit the production and circulation of PDF, HTML or other derivative renderings of the source ASCIIDOC, (with the exception for personal use only, not shared with others).

You can't translate this book without permission. You can't create ebooks in PDF, HTML EPUB or any other format unless it is for personal use only and not shared/distributed.

## Licensing change in 12 months

It is expected that the book will be released under a more permissive CC-BY-SA license within a year of publication (i.e. Jan 2023). At that time we will provide a Transifex project for volunteer translations and it will be allowed to produce and share PDF or other ebook versions of the book.
