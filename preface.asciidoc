[[code_examples_sec]]
=== Code Examples

((("code examples, obtaining and using")))The examples are illustrated in Go, C++, Python, and using the command line of a Unix-like operating system. All code snippets are available in the GitHub repository under the _code_ subdirectory. Fork the book code, try the code examples, or submit corrections via GitHub: https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook.

All the code snippets can be replicated on most operating systems with a minimal installation of compilers, interpreters, and libraries for the corresponding languages. Where necessary, we provide basic installation instructions and step-by-step examples of the output of those instructions.

Some of the code snippets and code output have been reformatted for print. In all such cases, the lines have been split by a backslash (+\+) character, followed by a newline character. When transcribing the examples, remove those two characters and join the lines again and you should see identical results to those shown in the example.

All the code snippets use real values and calculations where possible, so that you can build from example to example and see the same results in any code you write to calculate the same values. For example, the private keys and corresponding public keys and addresses are all real.

[[using_code_examples_sec]]
=== Using Code Examples

This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you're reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O'Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product's documentation does require permission.

((("attribution")))We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, ISBN, and copyright. For example: &#x201c;__Mastering the Lightning Network__ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Rene Pickhardt (O'Reilly). Copyright 2020, ISBN - xxx-xx-x-xxxxx."

[[addresses_and_transactions_sec]]
=== Addresses and Transactions in this Book

((("blockchain","warnings and cautions")))((("keys and addresses", seealso="cryptography; private keys; public keys")))((("QR codes")))((("transactions","warnings and cautions")))((("warnings and cautions","when using test and example material appearing in book")))The Bitcoin addresses, transactions, keys, QR codes, and blockchain data used in this book are, for the most part, real. That means you can browse the blockchain, look at the transactions offered as examples, retrieve them with your own scripts or programs, etc.

((("warnings and cautions","avoid sending money to addresses appearing in book")))However, note that the private keys used to construct the addresses printed in this book have been "burned." This means that if you send money to any of these addresses, the money will either be lost forever or (more likely) appropriated, since anyone who reads the book can take it using the private keys printed herein.

[WARNING]
====
DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANY OF THE ADDRESSES IN THIS BOOK. Your money will be taken by another reader, or lost forever.

[[acknowledgments_sec]]
=== Acknowledgments by Andreas

I owe my love of words and books to my mother, Theresa, who raised me in a house with books lining every wall. My mother also bought me my first computer in 1982, despite being a self-described technophobe. My father, Menelaos, a civil engineer who published his first book at 80 years old, was the one who taught me logical and analytical thinking and a love of science and engineering.

Thank you all for supporting me throughout this journey.

=== Acknowledgments by Rene

I want to mainly thank all the students I ever taught and who engaged into interesting discussions and questions.
Believe it or not from you I learnt the most.
I am also grateful to the Bitcoin and Lightning Network community who welcomed me and supported my efforts.
In particular I am grateful to all the open source Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocol developers and people who fund them to make that technology possible.
Last but not least I am thankful to my loved ones.
