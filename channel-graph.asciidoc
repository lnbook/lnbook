      - Which is the most efficient?
      - What is the "gossip query" system?
      - Does a node need to keep up with all gossip updates? Does this change if they're a routing node or mobile client?

### Gossip Announcements

#### How does a peer announce a new channel to the network?
Let's assume that Alice and Bob have just opened a channel together.
How do they let the rest of the network know, so that the channel can be used for forwarding payments?
Well firstly, they don't need to.
Alice and Bob can choose not to announce the channel and simply use it to transfer bitcoin between each other.
In this case, they won't earn any fees for forwarding payments.
However, assuming they do want the channel to be public, they will have marked the channel as public when they initially agreed to open it.

First, they'll have to wait until the funding transaction is confirmed (usually six confirmations).
Once it's confirmed, Alice's and Bob's nodes will now use the `channel_announcement` message to let the rest of the network know the good news.
This announcement message contains some important information:

* *Channel ID*: a short description of the channel that tells users which outputs in which transaction in which Bitcoin block were used to fund the channel
* *Signatures from Alice and Bob*: Remember that the channel funds are locked in a 2-of-2 multisignature address, for which Alice and Bob each hold one of the two keys.
Alice and Bob will each sign from their key, proving that their nodes control the funds in the channel.

They will then send this `channel_announcement` message to each of their peers.

Note that while the `channel_announcement` message makes their peers aware of their channel, their peers won't yet be able to use the channel for forwarding payments.
First, Alice or Bob will have to communicate other information, such as their fee policy, which we will discuss below.
But first, how do their peers verify that the channel announcement is legitimate?

#### Verifying the channel

Let's assume Wei receives this announcement from Bob.
How does he know that this is a real channel, and why should he even bother to check it?

Well, verifying a channel is pretty important.
If Wei tries to forward any payments through a channel that doesn't exist, his payments are going to fail.
Even if the channel does exist, Wei still needs assurances that Bob and Alice actually control the funds inside of it.
Alice and Bob could potentially dupe him by claiming ownership of a channel that actually belongs to someone else.
So Wei will definintely want to verify before he updates his channel graph.

Firstly, Wei will check the channel ID to discover which Bitcoin transaction contains the channel funds.
He will then look up this transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and he should discover a P2WSH bitcoin UTXO that is signed by both Alice and Bob.
Secondly, Wei will verify the signatures in the channel annoucenment message and confirm that the two nodes who signed the channel announcement are actually Alice and Bob.
Once he's done so, he's convinced that the channel is funded and that Alice and Bob are the funders and owners of that channel.
If any of these checks fail, he'll ignore the channel announcement.

Once Wei is satisifed that the channel announcement checks out, he'll update his channel graph.
He will also send information about this channel to his peers, and they will verify it for themselves.
